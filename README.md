# Lab5
CISC 3130 Fall 2020 Lab #5

This repository was created to display my source code, 4 input files in CSV format, and the output text file of the fourth lab assignment in CISC 3130. The assigment for the course was to take in multiple CSV files containing weekly reports of the top streamed music and music artists on Spotfy Charts. And to use this data and display all songs from the multiple input files and the artists from each song and take the average amount of stream plays for the weeks it was displayed at the span of 4 weeks.

# Installation
The following information will instruct the user on how to run my program and as well describe the technologies I used.

## Dependencies/Technologies
* Java 8 IDE (Netbeans 8.2) https://netbeans.org/downloads/8.2/rc/

Netbeans is a free and open source integrated development environment (IDE) for Java. It runs on Windows, macOS, Linux and Solaris operating systems. I used this IDE to create/compile/run this program. I as well used and integrated multiple CSV files from Spotify Charts https://spotifycharts.com/regional/global/weekly/latest

## Setup/Instructions
These are the steps to compile CISCLab5.java and run the program CISCLab5. Source code is found in the src file under cisclab5. The CSV files are in order of each week I used from October 15, 2020 to November 5, 2020, which is the span of only 4 weeks (or 4 CSV files).
For how to use command line workflow such as terminal:

1. Sign up for a Github account if you don't have one. Set up your SSH keys with github.
2. Clone this repository to your machine to get a copy.
3. Move into the project's root directory with cd lab5
4. Move again into the subdirectory cisclab5 using the command cd cisclab5
5. Compile the java file using the java complier command javac CISCLab5.java
6. Run the complied java program with java command java CISCLab5

The output should be the same as the output text file output.txt

## Folder Structure
* Source code is saved into the cisclab5 folder.
* Data can be seen when opening the CISCLab5 folder, which is 4 CSV files with each containing data of a certain week of top streaming music on Spotify Charts.
* Output is called output.txt which is seen when opening the CISCLab5 folder.
